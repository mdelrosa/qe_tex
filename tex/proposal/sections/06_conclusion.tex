In this proposal, we discussed techniques for efficient MIMO channel state information (CSI) estimation. We outlined the author's prior work using spherical normalization, which scales each CSI sample by its power, and a deep learning framework for differential encoding, which exploits temporal correlation between CSI at subsequent timeslots. We presented initial results for neural network with trainable quantization for practical CSI feedback quantization, and we outline possible extensions which will enable rate-optimal encoding of CSI including ROI encoding and differential encoding.
