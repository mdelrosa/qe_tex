In this proposal, we discussed techniques for efficient MIMO channel state information (CSI) estimation. We outlined the author's prior work using spherical normalization, which scales each CSI sample by its power, and a deep learning framework for differential encoding, which exploits temporal correlation between CSI at subsequent timeslots. We outlined a future research effort in soft-to-hard vector quantization for practical CSI feedback compression, and we presented initial results based on the SHVQ framework for this network.
